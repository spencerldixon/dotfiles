# Dotfiles

My split window vim, and iterm2 setup for Ruby on Rails development

## Installation

Run these commands from your command line to use the install script:

```
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/spencerldixon/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Updating

It's just git! Pull and push as you would normally. You will need to run the installation script each time to copy new files and folders.
